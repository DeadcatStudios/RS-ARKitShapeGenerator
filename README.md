# RS-ARKitShapeGenerator

this plugin is based on a video royal skies created for setting up shapekeys using a rig

at least what i interpreted as his common workflow for the process to something usable in blender
somewhat close......i think 

Blender Addon Creates a ARKit Pose List and generate shapekeys from poses

Installation:
-got to blender/preferences/addons
-press install
-select the py File
-enable the plugin


how to use:
-select the armature you want to create the ARkit Face poses for
-in the item tab in the 3DView press generate Pose List

a action will be created with pose markers for each ARKit shape you want to fill

-after creating all of your poses, select the skinned meshes you want to create the shapes keys for
-press the "generate shape keys" button

"aaaannnnnndd......you'r done" -RoyalSkies



ive only tested the script on one rig so your milage may vary

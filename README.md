# RS-ARKitShapeGenerator

this plugin is based on a video royal skies created for setting up shapekeys using a rig

at least what i interpreted as his common workflow for the process to something usable in blender
somewhat close......i think 

Blender Addon Creates a ARKit Pose List and generate shapekeys from poses

Installation:

- got to blender/preferences/addons
- press install
- select the py File
- enable the plugin

how to use:

- select the armature you want to create the ARkit Face poses for
- in the item tab in the 3DView press generate Pose List

a action will be created with pose markers for each ARKit shape you want to fill
